# desktop-os-mockup

A JavaScript website that simulates a Windows desktop environment. It uses familiar controls: double-click to open, drag to move, minimize, and click the taskbar to reopen windows.

This site uses web components to modularize the creation of "apps" by placing app content (HTML) into a window web component that manages the window interactions.

This project uses plain JavaScript (no build tools) while leveraging built-in web components and avoids external libraries.

## Features

*   **Window Management:** Drag, minimize, and restore windows.
*   **Double-Click to Open:** Open "apps" with a double-click.
*   **Taskbar Integration:** Click on the taskbar to restore minimized windows.
*   **Modular "Apps":** Built using web components for easy app creation.
*   **Pure JavaScript:** No build tools or external libraries.
